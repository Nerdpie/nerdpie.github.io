Since this repo serves as a simple website for myself, Nerdpie, I don't expect many contributions.  That being said, if you do find something that could be improved, please let me know!

For a "code of conduct", I'm going to keep it simple: don't be a jerk.

With that out of the way, thanks for stopping by!
